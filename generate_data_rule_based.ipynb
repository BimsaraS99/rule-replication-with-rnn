    "### Description of the Data Generation Method\n",
    "\n",
    "This data generation method creates a synthetic dataset of variable-length numerical sequences along with corresponding binary labels based on a predefined rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequence Generation:**\n",
    "  Each sequence consists of random integers ranging from 0 to 9. The length of each sequence is randomly chosen within a specified range (default between 3 and 10 elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Labeling Rule:**\n",
    "  The label for each sequence is binary and determined by the parity of the sum of its elements. If the sum is even, the label is `1`; if odd, the label is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Formatting:**\n",
    "  To handle sequences of varying lengths, each sequence is padded to a fixed maximum length (default 10) with a special padding value (`-1`). This ensures uniform input size for machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Output Format:**\n",
    "  The dataset is saved as a CSV file where each column represents an element of the padded sequence (`step_1`, `step_2`, ..., `step_10`), followed by the `label` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach facilitates training sequence models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to learn and replicate the underlying parity-based rule from variable-length sequences."
